# Sonos ZP Controller

This Node.js-based web application is meant to control a Sonos ZonePlayer, acting as a proxy between
a client in a browser and the ZonePlayer.

All Sonos systems are based on UPnP. This project thus contains a UPnP client library.

app.js is the main server file ready to be run by Node
